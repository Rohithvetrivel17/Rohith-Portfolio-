      <button class="accordion">QR-Based Frame Tracking System</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Frame parts were often misplaced, causing rework and delays during production at Doosan Bobcat.</p>
        <p><strong>What I did:</strong> Collaborated with Quality to develop a QR-based tracking system using SharePoint and Power Apps. Designed a fixture to hold frames and link scans to Apriso ERP.</p>
        <p><strong>Hurdles:</strong> Misalignment between ERP and scanned data, and missed frame tagging by operators.</p>
        <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Achieved 100% frame traceability and reduced rework by 12%. Improved Apriso release accuracy to 100%.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Tooling Fixture Design (14 Fixtures)</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Delays due to inefficient assembly tooling and repeated component repositioning.</p>
        <p><strong>What I did:</strong> Designed 14 fixtures using SolidWorks/Creo and applied GD&T. Validated ergonomics and usability via operator trials.</p>
        <p><strong>Hurdles:</strong> CAD-operator misalignment and fixture fabrication delays.</p>
        <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Boosted line efficiency by 20%, saving ~2.3 hours/week of downtime.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Cost Reduction at MM Motors</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Overstock and dead inventory due to poor demand forecasting and unstructured BOM usage.</p>
        <p><strong>What I did:</strong> Revamped BOM, used SAP MRP for demand forecasting, and launched incentive-based inventory clearance.</p>
        <p><strong>Hurdles:</strong> Lack of team buy-in and outdated sales data.</p>
        <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Reduced dead stock by 70%, improved forecast accuracy by 68%, and boosted accessory sales by 50%.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">UK Road Accident Dashboard (Tableau)</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Lack of insights into accident patterns across the UK.</p>
        <p><strong>What I did:</strong> Created a Tableau dashboard with KPI filters, heatmaps, severity and time-based clustering.</p>
        <p><strong>Hurdles:</strong> Data noise and coordinate overlap in dense zones.</p>
        <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Enabled data-driven safety recommendations for regional planning and law enforcement prioritization.</p>
